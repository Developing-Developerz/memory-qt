# Goal Of The Repository

This repository describes the implementation of an open-source Memory game in Qt, applying principles of software architecture such as requirements gathering and object-oriented analysis and design.

This project uses the [Qt Widgets? / Qt Quick? TBD] approach.

[Use cases](#use-cases) and [requirements](#requirements) are kept in the documentation directory (`docs`).

# Description Of The Application

Memory (also known as Concentration) is a card game in which all cards are dealt face down, and two cards are turned face up each turn. The object of the game is to locate pairs of matching cards in as few moves as possible.

# Download Compiled Binaries
